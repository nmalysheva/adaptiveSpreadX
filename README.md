# adaptiveSpreadX

## Description
The adaptiveSpreadX Python Package is a simulation tool designed for modeling and analyzing spreading dynamics on adaptive contact networks. Leveraging the innovative [SSATAN-X](		https://doi.org/10.1051/mmnp/2022035) algorithm, this package enables users to simulate various spreading processes with adaptability and precision. This project is suitable for researchers, developers, and anyone interested in studying the behavior of spreading dynamics.

## Features

- **Adaptive Contact Networks**: Simulate spreading dynamics on networks that adapt and evolve.
- **SSATAN-X Algorithm**: Utilizes the cutting-edge SSATAN-X algorithm for accurate simulations.
- **Versatile Modeling**: Suitable for a wide range of applications including epidemiology, information dissemination, and more.
- **User-Friendly API**: Easy-to-use API for configuring and running simulations.

## Installation

\```bash
pip install ssatanx
\```

## Quickstart

\```python
import ssatanx

# Initialize network and configure simulation parameters
network = ssatanx.AdaptiveContactNetwork()
simulation = ssatanx.Simulation(network)

# Run the simulation
simulation.run()

# Analyze and visualize results
simulation.visualize()
\```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available at [Documentation Link](#).

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Spreading Simulation

\```python
import ssatanx

# Configure and run a basic spreading simulation
network = ssatanx.AdaptiveContactNetwork(parameters)
simulation = ssatanx.Simulation(network, spreading_parameters)
results = simulation.run()

# Analyze results
\```

### Example 2: Advanced Network Adaptation

\```python
import ssatanx

# Configure network adaptation parameters
adaptation_parameters = {
    # ...
}

# Initialize and run the simulation with network adaptation
network = ssatanx.AdaptiveContactNetwork(adaptation_parameters)
simulation = ssatanx.Simulation(network)
results = simulation.run()

# Analyze results
\```
